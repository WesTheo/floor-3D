# 🖼️ Texture Setup Guide

## The Problem
The texture selection isn't working because the texture files in `public/textures/` are placeholder files, not actual JPG images.

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Use the Texture Generator (Recommended)
1. Open `texture-downloader.html` in your browser
2. Click "Generate All Textures" 
3. Download each texture file
4. Save them to `floor-preview-app/public/textures/` replacing the placeholder files

### Option 2: Create Simple Textures Manually
1. Open any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create a 200x100 pixel image
3. Fill with wood-like colors and add grain lines
4. Save as JPG in the `public/textures/` folder

### Option 3: Use Online Texture Generators
- Visit sites like: https://www.toptal.com/developers/css/sprite-generator
- Generate wood-like patterns
- Download and save to the textures folder

## Required Files
```
floor-preview-app/public/textures/
├── oak.jpg          (200x100, oak wood pattern)
├── walnut.jpg       (200x100, walnut wood pattern)  
├── gray-lvp.jpg     (200x100, gray LVP pattern)
└── demo-laminate.jpg (200x100, laminate pattern)
```

## Test the App
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Upload an image
3. Try changing textures - they should now work!
4. Try changing patterns - they should now be visible!

## Why This Happened
The original texture files were just placeholder text files, not actual images. The app needs real JPG files to display textures properly.

## Next Steps
Once you have real texture files, the app will:
- ✅ Display different floor textures
- ✅ Show pattern variations  
- ✅ Allow rotation and scaling
- ✅ Create professional floor visualizations
